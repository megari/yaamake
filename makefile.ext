# -*- makefile -*-
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is yaamake's makefile system. This makefile is splitted in multiple
# sources for easier code maintainability.
#
# Originally these makefiles have been WinAVR Makefile Template written by
# Eric B. Weddington, Jörg Wunsch, et al. which was released to the
# Public Domain
#
# Additional material for that orginal makefile was written by:
#  Peter Fleury
#  Tim Henigan
#  Colin O'Flynn
#  Reiner Patommel
#  Markus Pfaff
#  Sander Pool
#  Frederik Rouleau
#  Carlos Lamas
#
# So huge thanks to above people for their great work. I hope our new work
# would help them too.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# After including this file to your projects makefile,
# following commands can be used:
#
# make all = Make software.
#
# make clean = Clean out built project files.
#
# make coff = Convert ELF to AVR COFF.
#
# make extcoff = Convert ELF to AVR Extended COFF.
#
# make program = Download the hex file to the device, using avrdude.
#
# make debug = Start either simulavr or avarice as specified for debugging, 
#              with avr-gdb or avr-insight as the front end for debugging.
#
# make filename.s = Just compile filename.c into the assembler code only.
#
# make filename.i = Create a preprocessed source file for use in submitting
#                   bug reports to the GCC project.
#
#
# To rebuild project do "make clean" then "make all".
