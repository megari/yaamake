Yet Another AVR Make
====================

Yaamake is handy makefile system to be used with gnu make for building and programming AVR projects
IT allows you to write simple `Makefile` with few variable definitions and supplies lot of defined targets (actions).

Yaamake is mainly used by [YAAL](https://github.com/raphendyr/yaal) project, but it's also very useful separately.
